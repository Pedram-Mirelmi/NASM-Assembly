# NASM-Assembly
This repo contains some HWs and project about NASM assembly language
## HW1:
-   #### LCF: to find the least common factor of two numbers
-   #### Gcc: to find the greates common divisor
-   #### Complete: to determine if a number is complete(A number is complete iff the sum of its divisors equals the number)
-   #### Prime: to determine if a number is prime
-   #### digitAdd: to sum the digits in a given number
-   #### digitAddEo: to sum the even and odd digits of a number
-   #### BCD: to convert a number in the BCD representation to binary representation with a special algorithm
## HW2:
-   #### reverseBit: to read a number in decimal representation and output the 64bit revered binary representation
-   #### countOne: to read a number in decimal representation and output the number of `1`s in the binary represenatation
-   #### countOneM: to read an `i` and a `j` and a string `s` and count the `1`s in the memory in which `s` is located from index `i` to index `j`
-   #### QuickSort: to read a size `n` and `n` numbers after if(the array elements each at a new line) and then sort the array and output it
-   #### binarySearch: to read a sorted array like the `QuickSort` problem. Then read number `q` which is the number of questions and then read `q` numbers each at a new line and output the index of that number in the array -if is present- and `NaN` if not
## HW3:
-   #### minDifFp: to read an array of floating point numbers like `QuickSort` problem and then find the two number with the minimum difference
-   #### seriFp: to read the `n` and then `x` and then calculate and output the result of the sum: sum\[k=0, n\] (1/k!)*(x^k)
## HW4:
-   #### lightenImage: to read a path to a directory `path` and then the number `n`. Then read all the images with the format of `bmp` in that directory and lighten them `n` degrees and save them to `path/edited_photos`
