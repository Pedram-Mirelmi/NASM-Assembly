# A mini project, the lighten image!
## The test images and the results are in the directory `./Images/`
### HW5:
-   #### lightenImage: to read a path to a directory `path` and then the number `n`. Then read all the images with the format of `bmp` in that directory and lighten them `n` degrees and save them to `path/edited_photos`. It is necessesary to use parallel `nasm` instruction (like `vmovdqa` or `vpaddusb` or `vpsubusb`) while lightening the pixels of the image
